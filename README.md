### What is the project about? ###

This is a small academic project for my functional and logic programming course. It leverages the Prolog language and the Yelp API to create an interactive city guide. It can help tourists find things such as restaurants, museums, parks, etc... in any major city around the world.

Prolog is used for Natural Language Processing to parse plain English user queries. The Yelp API is then used to retrieve the relevant data. This data is then returned to the user in a user-friendly way.


Examples queries: 
- What are five restaurants in Vancouver?
- Give me two museums in Chicago!


How to run the program?  
Load main.pl in SWI Prolog and then run the query "run.".
